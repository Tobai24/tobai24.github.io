Hello everyone,  

As some of you might know, I haven’t published any entries on this blog yet. I’ve been busy working on various projects in quantitative imaging, AI, and nuclear medicine.  

Now I finally have the time and space to share my insights, experiences, and tutorials with you. My goal is to **publish at least one post per week**—covering topics such as:

- Quantitative imaging techniques in nuclear medicine (PET, SPECT, etc.)
- Applications of artificial intelligence in medical imaging
- Practical tips for researchers and clinicians
- Tools, datasets, and code examples for imaging analysis

I hope this blog will be a place where enthusiasts, students, and professionals can learn, discuss, and explore the intersection of **AI and nuclear medicine**.  

Stay tuned for the first technical post, where I’ll introduce **how AI is transforming PET scan analysis**.  

Looking forward to this journey with you!
