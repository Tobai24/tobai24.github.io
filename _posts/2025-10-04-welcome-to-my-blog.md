Hello everyone,  

I’ve long wanted a space to discuss ideas, explain concepts, and teach what I’m learning, and I think this blog is the perfect place to make that happen. My goal is to **publish at least one post every two weeks**, covering topics such as:


- Quantitative imaging techniques in nuclear medicine (PET, SPECT, etc.)  
- Applications of artificial intelligence in medical imaging  
- Tools, datasets, and code examples for imaging analysis  

I hope this blog becomes a space where enthusiasts, students, and professionals can learn, discuss, and explore the intersection of **AI and nuclear medicine**.  

**Stay tuned for the first tutorial next week**, where I’ll dive into **PET image preprocessing using Python**, sharing practical code, workflows, and tips for getting started with quantitative PET analysis.  

I look forward to embarking on this journey with you!
